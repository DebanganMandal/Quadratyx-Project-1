But at this price ranges, there shouldn't be much to complain about. But there is, from non expanding storage to iTunes and now to Apple slowing down old models performance. Say whatever you want - but they do that to make money, to force you to upgrade to better phone. Slow charger you get with iPhone X or removal of headphone jack is just an example of it. From no customization which sucks, now we are coming to other stuff that Apple does to make more money out of you. The same goes with the insane costs to replace front and/or back glass on new iPhones. They are innovative, and they could make even better products, but they are more interested in profit.

Even worse that some websites have started giving discounts of 2000/- to 5000/- . Google understood its position and worth in the Indian market and Pixel 2 was discounted to Rs 39990/- . Long story short all those people who even travelled to Hong Kong so that they may sell in India at a profit made a royal fool of themselves.

It too got a little slower into its second year but not as bad as the s2. I replaced the s4 with an s6 and kept it for 2 years and it was perfect. No lags or slowing down, a massive improvement over the s2 and also an improvement over the s4. I now have an s8 and it is just superb in every way - speed, screen, camera etc. It certainly suits my purpose and proves that competition eventually brings out the best in everything.

       " 'The reason I stick with Apple year after year, even though they consistently fail to add or change features I would like and could have on an Android device, is stability. ThatÂ?s it. I need my phone to work, consistently, especially for the core functions of a communication device - email, text, Internet, messaging apps, etc.  I switched from Android with the iPhone 4 because it blew every existing Android device away in terms of speed and reliability in daily use.  Benchmarks are and were irrelevant to me; they donÂ?t console me when my phone freezes or reboots itself, when apps crash or fail to load or get sluggish, when messages mysteriously dissolve or fail to send.  These are problems I have never had on an iPhone. The Â?it just worksÂ? factor becomes really important when you rely on a device for critical communication for business. These days there are really impressive Android phones that seem to beat the iPhone out of the gate, even in actual speed tests and daily use case scenarios. But I know people who actually own those devices and I *still* see them stutter and fail at important tasks on occasion - something I literally never experience as an iOS user. Yes, bugs have creeped into iOS in recent iterations (which have generally been quickly squashed). But nothing which has caused slowdown or failure of essential tasks. And Android phones suffer from another frustrating problem IÂ?ve never experienced in iOS: slowdown over time. IÂ?ve never had to fully restore an iOS device to get it running without lag again. Ever. But that seems to be commonplace among Android devices. O donÂ?t have time in my life to be fiddling with my phone to get it running how I need it to work. Every cool and supposedly more convenient new feature that comes out on Android May seem like a reason to switch, but it always comes back to reliability for me. Over the course of my workday, I just need stuff to work how it should work when I want to use it, even if itÂ?s a fairly vanilla version of the thing. ThatÂ?s what keeps in in the iOS ecosystem.

       " \"Alex, 12 Nov 2017Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus\\r\\r\\nAnd iphone x should be iphone 8Yes I agree as I already said, Apple and Samsung were two of the last companies to hold the physical home button when everyone else adopted on screen buttons, this year both companies decided to get rid of home buttons in their flagships and what we got to know about each one's approach. \\r\\r\\nSamsung removed the home button but tried to keep the overall experience same for its users. The back button on right side tho it can be changed to left now. A recent apps button and a 3d touch always on home button which wasn't seen in any phone till now, iPhone 7 had it but it wasn't embedded in the display itself. So a Samsung user coming from older models like S5, S6 or S7 will get almost the same experience. The fingerprint sensor was put to back this time but the phone can still be unlocked the same way, press the always on home button without waking up the phone while looking at the display and the phone will be unlocked in no time by the iris scanner giving an impression of inbuilt fingerprint sensor. The bottom navigation panel with back home and recent buttons can be hidden easily by two taps tho the home button will still be functioning on pressing the area where it's embedded giving the same experience of physical home button while watching videos, playing games and using any app. The overall experience was enhanced by options like swipe down anywhere on display for notification panel and swipe up anywhere for apps, these settings can be changed according to taste.  \\r\\r\\nThe other one is Apple which being the first company to bring 3d touch and a 3d touch home button in iPhone 7 strangely couldn't implement an always on 3d touch home button in display in their most premium phone till date. What they came up with is a swipe up line which is a user nightmare. To ruin it more there are things like swipe down from left of notch for notification, from right of notch for control center. The experience is no where near what people are used to and what they'll be using in future when inbuilt fingerprint sensor will come. The unlocking takes more time now due to the swipe even after face verification. Apple's rushed software approach for an anniversary edition makes an arrogant image of Apple. They are saying like'' if you want a phone which has demanded features samsung's display and bezel-less design then you'll have to pay extra and will have to accept unfinished non practical software. Otherwise keep buying what we are giving you from years and don't complain ''. I think and everyone thinks that iPhone x was supposed to be the main device of the year, they could name it as iPhone 8,X or anything but it was supposed to in the place of iPhone 8 as the next iPhone. It's a direct competitior to S8 which is a usual successor of previous device not an anniversary edition sold at premium price. Apple + amoled and unfinished software can't make it a more expensive device than the current iPhone of the year. I'm sure iPhone 8 and 8 plus users who will spend a flagship amount will be left with a device which even the company doesn't approve as their current flagship. IPhone 8 wasn't supposed to come this year. IPhone x was supposed to be the main device.\",\n",

They could choose more expensive curved displays (570 ppi as in S8) but Apple decided to save cost and put a normal display in a curved glass panel which could easily fit a curved display as rumored earlier. Apple did the software tweaks and now the display is same as a lcd which means you get a lcd like oled with added risk of burn ins and lines as the software isn't revamped to avoid burn ins like Samsung do by slightly moving icons and buttons and moving always on features to avoid burn ins. Iphone x lcd like oled will definitely eat up eyes. \",\n",

       " 'Its iPhone tenth anniversary time and Apple had to think diffferent to commemorate it. The iPhone X attempts to setup a change in the design language and UI gestures for the next few years.  Of course when you have a massive user base making big changes means bringing those users with you. Yes things will probably change a bit based on user feedback, this is a Gen 1 product, and yes the software will catch up with the hardware - Animoji is just a fun proof of concept to push developers to come up with their own ideas.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nHaving finally got one (thanks istocknow.com for the live stock pushes!) my initial thoughts are this. Screen is something else. Oled looks very good, but Ive noticed my iPad Pro screen looks better in any light than my 6S plus scree, and this seems to prove Truetone/HDR is key.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID (shame you cant register two faces - I guess the bionic ML hardware isnt fast enough - A12 anyone - or the software isnt up to it yet?), and its quicker to setup.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nSpeed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device but no comparison to a DLSR (though those can be thousands with good lenses!). However, its a big improvement on the 6S plus and I thought that had a good camera. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIs it worth the equivalent price of a 12 next week inch MacBook? Thats a personal decision but if you dont want to spend quite that much but want an iPhone, the iPhone 8 (and even 7) are mighty good phones with most of the functionality and very good LCD screens. But if you really really really want a X then consider the Apple Upgrade Programme. Its a way of paying monthly, its 0%, you get Applecare Plus, and you can upgrade to the Gen 2 product next year if you want or just continue paying it off.',\n",

They do slow down the older phones, but it isn\\'t without a reason. Most older phones have been out for years and people have had them for years. I had the original six until I got the Iphone X. The problem is with ANY older phone is that because of apps using more than ever before in terms of RAM, Etc. Most phones don\\'t last 6 hour let alone a day.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nWhile I don\\'t agree that Apple hasn\\'t offered the choice, it is a clever decision because that if you look on Apple\\'s top reviews is the main complaint(Apart from the price, but those complaints aren\\'t really viable or relatable to this).\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nPlease in future, do not post illogical and radical conclusions without first inserting the slightest bit on knowledge.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nHave a nice day, \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nDropDeadDreadmaw AppleProductsAreShit, 26 Dec 2017Seriously?!

A great phone for whom who can afford it. I really don`t recommend just because of the price tag.  To sum up: The iPhone X is awesome device, and so are other iPhones. They maybe did had downsides like no wireless charging or lacks of features, but with recent iPhones that\\'s not the case. Also the RAM managment and software optimization are unmatched. And security/privacy on iOS is much better too. \\r\\r\\nBut, now there is the catch. It does cost a lot, which is also even understandable because of what it brings to the table. But at this price ranges, there shouldn\\'t be much to complain about. But there is, from non expanding storage to iTunes and now to Apple slowing down old models performance. Say whatever you want - but they do that to make money, to force you to upgrade to better phone. Slow charger you get with iPhone X or removal of headphone jack is just an example of it. From no customization which sucks, now we are coming to other stuff that Apple does to make more money out of you. The same goes with the insane costs to replace front and/or back glass on new iPhones. They are innovative, and they could make even better products, but they are more interested in profit. And that\\'s the reason why I personally don\\'t have an iPhone, even though I like iPhones Zack, 23 Dec 2017Shocking!!!....now you know why Apple is a  trillion dollar company !

I recently purchased one of these phones.  It has been a cracking handset and I do not regret the cost at all.  It is expensive but the quality it brings to the table more than compensates for this.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIt reminds me of a sandwich I once purchased from a more upmarket and reputable brasserie.  It was a gloriously lush and plentiful bounty with an abundance of Ham and lashings of other meats and salad.  My friend told me it would be a waste of money but, after he saw it in all its glory he instantly regretted his choice of artisan parsnip soup with crusty roll.  The soup WAS good, don\\'t get me wrong, but the glory of my sandwich overshadowed the whole affair. \\r\\r\\nMy friend even goes so far as to say that it is the BIGGEST regret of his adult life and that he has ordered the sandwich multiple times since then and that it has never been made to the same glorious standards as the first time he laid his envious eyes upon it.  He has since fallen out with me as I never let him taste even the smallest bite of this magical creation.  i have received several threatening emails and lewd phone calls asking me to explain the feelings associated with eating the sandwich of sandwiches.  I can only decline to do this as re-living this visceral experience will probably drive me to very edge of my own sanity, even the brief memory of the enticing aroma is enough to push me close to the greatest moment of my life and, in that moment, i maybe tempted to end my thoughts there and slip into the bliss that was the perfectly seasoned mayonnaise dressed Excalibur Sandwich, a Sandwich fit for a king.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nBut I can\\'t, because I still have 19 months payments left on my phone.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nOh yes, and my friend thinks the phone is alright, but he likes traditional headphones soooo...  jtrogr, 22 Dec 2017The phone is good but I returned it for 2 main reasons:\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n1.

Iphone X deal has always been shady right from the beginning . Apple did a very bad business deal in India . Apple also created artificial hype and fake demand around it. In India Flipkart took deal for online sale . In the initial wave Flipkart may be had a stock of 1000 phones for the entire India .The entire pre order sold out in 3 minutes. Also the very day of the release the stocks went out in 5 minutes. People even went out and purchased the more expensive 256 GB in anticipation that Iphone X may not be available ever again. Well then reviews started pouring and and speed tests were live in Youtube and itit was the unanimous opinion that the mobile phone is unique and very good but never worth Rs 89000/- ( 1300 dollars for 64 Gb) . 1 month later the 2nd wave of sale took place and guess what , Iphone X is not selling like hot cakes anymore . Even worse that some websites have started giving discounts of 2000/- to 5000/- . Google understood its position and worth in the Indian market and Pixel 2 was discounted to Rs 39990/- . Long story short all those people who even travelled to Hong Kong so that they may sell in India at a profit made a royal fool of themselves. Apple also to rspect the Indian market and sell at a price not more than 65000/- . I guess another month more and the Iphone X will be discounted nevertheless.

Now it might look distinctive and great for marketing as it stands out in the crowd ...yeah you will certainly notice it. ......but for me , it\\'s a deal breaker...... big NO, NO. ...not good!!

A, 07 Dec 2017Thanks pal!Hey, no probs\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIf you have not done so already it\\'s well worth really taking time out to look at the differences before buying especially considering the price that you are going to be paying.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nFor example, if you have not done so already it\\'s worth reading some of the smaller print \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nE.G\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n\"Apple claims the X has a 5.8\" screen... except it\\'s not what you may imagine this to be. You can see on the official site that the 5.8\" measurement is for a rectangular screen while the X has rounded corners. But that\\'s a minor quibble; the bigger issue is that there\\'s a cutout at the top of the screen, which limits the usable area.\"\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n\"In fact, ignoring the top portion leaves a screen that\\'s just about 18.5:9 in aspect ratio. If you were to show 16:9 content on it - the traditional widescreen format that all TV shows and YouTube videos use - you\\'re left with what is effectively\\xa0a 4.96\" screen.

Personally I like the latest trend of 19.5:9 ratio (X) and the 18.5:9 (e.g Galaxy S8) but it comes at a price e.g Videos are stretched or to see the videos as intended you will have to put up with black bars either side of the video you are watching and in doing so you don\\'t make use of the full screen. Also you may want to take the \\'notch\\' into consideration too. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe IPhone 8 plus offers the more traditional 16:9 ratio,  but its all about preference and I would advise that you check the phones out in person if the screen is the big deal breaker for you. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nEveryone has an opinion but there is only one opinion that matters and that is yours.

Now donÂ?t fret over your choice.

I started with an s2 (about the same time as the iph4). It was a good phone but it started to get noticeably tired and slower into its second year. I replaced it with an s4 which was much better. It too got a little slower into its second year but not as bad as the s2. I replaced the s4 with an s6 and kept it for 2 years and it was perfect. No lags or slowing down, a massive improvement over the s2 and also an improvement over the s4. I now have an s8 and it is just superb in every way - speed, screen, camera etc. It certainly suits my purpose and proves that competition eventually brings out the best in everything. Iphone was the best and has improved with every new model. Samsung had to make massive improvements over the years to try reach the level of Apple. I believe that Samsung has now succeeded and I believe that both iphone 8 and Samsung s8 are pretty much equal.

ThatÂ?s it. I need my phone to work, consistently, especially for the core functions of a communication device - email, text, Internet, messaging apps, etc.  I switched from Android with the iPhone 4 because it blew every existing Android device away in terms of speed and reliability in daily use.  Benchmarks are and were irrelevant to me; they donÂ?t console me when my phone freezes or reboots itself, when apps crash or fail to load or get sluggish, when messages mysteriously dissolve or fail to send.  These are problems I have never had on an iPhone. The Â?it just worksÂ? factor becomes really important when you rely on a device for critical communication for business. These days there are really impressive Android phones that seem to beat the iPhone out of the gate, even in actual speed tests and daily use case scenarios. But I know people who actually own those devices and I *still* see them stutter and fail at important tasks on occasion - something I literally never experience as an iOS user. Yes, bugs have creeped into iOS in recent iterations (which have generally been quickly squashed). But nothing which has caused slowdown or failure of essential tasks. And Android phones suffer from another frustrating problem IÂ?ve never experienced in iOS: slowdown over time. IÂ?ve never had to fully restore an iOS device to get it running without lag again. Ever. But that seems to be commonplace among Android devices. O donÂ?t have time in my life to be fiddling with my phone to get it running how I need it to work. Every cool and supposedly more convenient new feature that comes out on Android May seem like a reason to switch, but it always comes back to reliability for me. Over the course of my workday, I just need stuff to work how it should work when I want to use it, even if itÂ?s a fairly vanilla version of the thing. ThatÂ?s what keeps in in the iOS ecosystem.

My point being to the original post that\\'s SPECS aren\\'t all they are cracked up to be as the speed test confirmed. Apple will always be a monopoly because of their proprietary software but to suggest they shouldn\\'t be compared to other devices is disingenuous and a disservice to the members of this forum.   Interesting that apple always gets a pass when issues arise, yet when budget devices need a small fix, their users are immediately ostracized for being cheap to even buy such a budget device, regardless of how big is the issue in both cases.

They are a one of a kind company because none of their products use a cross platform OS. THE IPHONE X is FAST ENOUGH, AND RUNS ON ITS OWN PLAYING FIELD. You cannot compare it to an android, because an android lacks the apple OS, its your prefference, if you like android, then talk about androids vs other androids.

I was expecting much better from Apple with the X but it just didn\\'t happen. So much for iPhone X being the King of Speed. The OnePlus 5T android device, which you can purchase for under $500.00 USD just crushed iPhone X in real time navigation testing.

So what makes the iphone 8 so expensive to make. S8 has all the features of an iPhone 8 in fact more but yet cheaper to buy? That\\'s with a Touch id scanner and Iris.

I\\'ve had it since Saturday and I have to say, this is the perfect smartphone on every single level. Apple have not only caught up, they\\'ve steered clear of Android now. Hardware is unbelievable. Now if only they can improve iOS 11, it would truly be the greatest device ever. Don\\'t listen to Android trolls, if you can afford this, get it now Drop test results by SquareTrade Labs aren\\'t encouraging. iPhone X is \"the most breakable, highest priced and most expensive to repair EVER!\" Smaller logic board is harder to repair, multiple cables harder to remove, divided battery harder to remove. $549.00 just to repair the glass case which isn\\'t covered under Apple Warranty. You can buy a new iPhone 7 for that amount. Handle with care!\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_OT1FQSWuU&\\xadfeature=youtu.be  A very important video you must watch, enjoy\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/O2tjWI7NarM  my new iPhone x just arrived,, smooth ,, fast and lovely,, no lag what so ever,, can use it with one hand. &#128525;&#128525;&#128525; this is the first phone ever made that i must say-its perfect!

Gone are those days ..iphone x is the future of smartphones.... Stocks sold within minutes in the world and remember it was not Mi this time it was iphone x yhe most expensive phone!! Even in US this phone is available in grey market forget abt the world!! The cost of second hand phone osore than the mrp.!!! Probably those who bought it are not fools.!!! Have a gud day!! Alex, 12 Nov 2017Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus\\r\\r\\nAnd iphone x should be iphone 8Yes I agree as I already said, Apple and Samsung were two of the last companies to hold the physical home button when everyone else adopted on screen buttons, this year both companies decided to get rid of home buttons in their flagships and what we got to know about each one\\'s approach. \\r\\r\\nSamsung removed the home button but tried to keep the overall experience same for its users. The back button on right side tho it can be changed to left now. A recent apps button and a 3d touch always on home button which wasn\\'t seen in any phone till now, iPhone 7 had it but it wasn\\'t embedded in the display itself. So a Samsung user coming from older models like S5, S6 or S7 will get almost the same experience. The fingerprint sensor was put to back this time but the phone can still be unlocked the same way, press the always on home button without waking up the phone while looking at the display and the phone will be unlocked in no time by the iris scanner giving an impression of inbuilt fingerprint sensor. The bottom navigation panel with back home and recent buttons can be hidden easily by two taps tho the home button will still be functioning on pressing the area where it\\'s embedded giving the same experience of physical home button while watching videos, playing games and using any app. The overall experience was enhanced by options like swipe down anywhere on display for notification panel and swipe up anywhere for apps, these settings can be changed according to taste.  \\r\\r\\nThe other one is Apple which being the first company to bring 3d touch and a 3d touch home button in iPhone 7 strangely couldn\\'t implement an always on 3d touch home button in display in their most premium phone till date. What they came up with is a swipe up line which is a user nightmare. To ruin it more there are things like swipe down from left of notch for notification, from right of notch for control center. The experience is no where near what people are used to and what they\\'ll be using in future when inbuilt fingerprint sensor will come. The unlocking takes more time now due to the swipe even after face verification. Apple\\'s rushed software approach for an anniversary edition makes an arrogant image of Apple. They are saying like\\'\\' if you want a phone which has demanded features samsung\\'s display and bezel-less design then you\\'ll have to pay extra and will have to accept unfinished non practical software. Otherwise keep buying what we are giving you from years and don\\'t complain \\'\\'. I think and everyone thinks that iPhone x was supposed to be the main device of the year, they could name it as iPhone 8,X or anything but it was supposed to in the place of iPhone 8 as the next iPhone. It\\'s a direct competitior to S8 which is a usual successor of previous device not an anniversary edition sold at premium price. Apple + amoled and unfinished software can\\'t make it a more expensive device than the current iPhone of the year. I\\'m sure iPhone 8 and 8 plus users who will spend a flagship amount will be left with a device which even the company doesn\\'t approve as their current flagship. IPhone 8 wasn\\'t supposed to come this year. IPhone x was supposed to be the main device. Anonymous, 13 Nov 2017Can some one explain why iPhone X display has exact (yes, absolutely exact) color depth as iPh... moreIphone x is using the same display(400+ ppi)  which samsung was using in S5. They could choose more expensive curved displays (570 ppi as in S8) but Apple decided to save cost and put a normal display in a curved glass panel which could easily fit a curved display as rumored earlier. Apple did the software tweaks and now the display is same as a lcd which means you get a lcd like oled with added risk of burn ins and lines as the software isn\\'t revamped to avoid burn ins like Samsung do by slightly moving icons and buttons and moving always on features to avoid burn ins. Iphone x lcd like oled will definitely eat up eyes.

That\\'s why I switch to Android after using iPhone for many years.Can some one explain why iPhone X display has exact (yes, absolutely exact) color depth as iPhone 8 plus?

Or did apple put LCD display and advertises it as Amoled?   \\r\\r\\nGo to any store (Best buy for example ) where both phones are sitting next to each other , switch the true tone (aka b.s. tone ) off on both of them and put the same wall paper in background and you will see that all colors are absolutely the same!

Noway, am waiting for iX compactBetter go for other brands with your desired price.  The notch itself is stylish and looks cool. Apple tried to make something completely bezel-less; since the front camera and speakers have to be present there, the only option remained was to put a notch there. I don\\'t understand why such fuss on this!  i am who has left from iphone user, coz of camera and NFC\\'s \\r\\r\\nfrom camera, the iphone just have a bit aperture, it mean that if u taking pictures at low light, it is fell too dark, then from NFC it just for apple pay, it is not necessary coz not support at any country why do apple not tell us the \"sensor sizing\" of the camera like other apple iphones do? currently apple main camera sensors are 1/3 of the size, but I think the iPhone 10 could be 1/2 size if the camera sensors on the back. Apple is not approaching its products modestly like Jobs did. They\\'re getting fancier day by day. Apple has lost its inventionary way. This phone is a fancy toy. I wouldn\\'t need to buy it besides old but good products of Apple Iphone. iX is good phone but price tag of iX should be about $299!!

Costly repair parts Iphone 8 and 8 Plus should be 7s and 7s plus \\r\\r\\nAnd iphone x should be iphone 8 Its iPhone tenth anniversary time and Apple had to think diffferent to commemorate it. The iPhone X attempts to setup a change in the design language and UI gestures for the next few years.  Of course when you have a massive user base making big changes means bringing those users with you. Yes things will probably change a bit based on user feedback, this is a Gen 1 product, and yes the software will catch up with the hardware - Animoji is just a fun proof of concept to push developers to come up with their own ideas.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nHaving finally got one (thanks istocknow.com for the live stock pushes!) my initial thoughts are this. Screen is something else. Oled looks very good, but Ive noticed my iPad Pro screen looks better in any light than my 6S plus scree, and this seems to prove Truetone/HDR is key.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI admit I was a bit worried about losing Touch ID but amazingly FaceID seems to work at least as well as TouchID (shame you cant register two faces - I guess the bionic ML hardware isnt fast enough - A12 anyone - or the software isnt up to it yet?), and its quicker to setup.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nSpeed is well ... wow ... just like the iPad Pro 10.5. Cameras ... amazing for such a small device but no comparison to a DLSR (though those can be thousands with good lenses!). However, its a big improvement on the 6S plus and I thought that had a good camera. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIs it worth the equivalent price of a 12 next week inch MacBook? Thats a personal decision but if you dont want to spend quite that much but want an iPhone, the iPhone 8 (and even 7) are mighty good phones with most of the functionality and very good LCD screens. But if you really really really want a X then consider the Apple Upgrade Programme. Its a way of paying monthly, its 0%, you get Applecare Plus, and you can upgrade to the Gen 2 product next year if you want or just continue paying it off. Glad to hear in new feature of iPhone X specially in benchmark. but feeling bad to say the notch make it even worse than original iPhone.

I\\'ve used Windows and Android before.. I was so at home with Windows, but Microsoft killed the phone.. Android was bearable - a little annoying at times (with unexplained delays) - but was fine..\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThen moved iPhone... Thought it is the greatest - I was wrong.. Even for basic operations - I was severely constrained. For instance, how do I take a backup of Photos physically (File copy) to PC ? It was virtually impossible unless you do it the \"iTunes\" way... And the backup to iCloud ? I paid close to USD1150 for this phone. And yet, I need to pay a subscription cost to iCloud - just for photo backup.. I paid unwillingly. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nGo to iTunes, they try to hard sell Apple Music .. I just don\\'t need it. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nLet\\'s not talk about Windows anymore.. It is more or less irrelevant.

I just saw the full screen youtube update. Kinda stupid if you ask me. The notch is still in the way. You call that full screen, Apple? Oh, also why is the phone so heavy? It have slimmer body and smaller display and battery compare to S8+ yet manage to be heavier.  If you a kind of person that love longer battery life you need to switch from iPhone X to Lenovo P2 (5110 mah) don\\'t only see the bezel-less. please also mind that this device is very heavy with only 2700mah battery, compared to the bigger and higher battery capacity in LG v30 which is lighter.

Camera is good enough, 4K videos at 30fps are not a problem. No optical zoom, true, but if that\\'s needed, one should pick DSLR anyway, dual cam - useless. Screen resolution is much better, as it\\'s standartized, unlike that of iP X. 5Mpix front camera is still OK for 1080p video.  \\r\\r\\nNo stereo speakers, true, but unneeded. No NFC, true, but most cards are unsupported so not really needed. \\r\\r\\nNo wireless charging, true, yet still it\\'s not practical and voice recognition is governed by Google or third parties.  \\r\\r\\nOn the other hand RMN4 has a headphone socket, IR port, 6 programmable buttons, fingerprint reader, dual sim and unlocked bootloader - all of which are more practical and all of which are lacking on iPhone X. \\r\\r\\nSo your comparison doesn\\'t really stand. Another thing I\\'ve dropped my s7 protected by a ballistic case numerous times that\\'s the main thing why I don\\'t get an S8 Plus and same way with the Apple x, well the processor is superior to the S7 I don\\'t know that to be the fact really you  want to spend $450 more  slightly increased processor.  Battery life is one issue even buy Samsung gallery 7 better battery life. Storage is an issue, not on my S7 phone. I used to home button to close out all. My brother has s8 plus .

The face unlock  feature has been flawless it works during the day during the night I had no issues at all with it and itÂ?s extremely fast you look at it and you could swipe up as fast as you look at it it doesnÂ?t hesitate at all. I heard someone say when you hit the power off that thereÂ?s a delay and that is far from  been  truth  itÂ?s instant on an instant off. All the apps everything is running very smooth all the games are flawless they love that Extra CPU speed that this has. If youÂ?re looking for an awesome phone at a fair market price this is a no-brainer youÂ?ve got to try one of these phones all I can tell you is I am so excited every time I turn on my phone and use it and I am very glad that I paid Just  A little extra for the Apple quality phone that youÂ?ll get. I would stop reading About it and just get one you will be so happy that you did.  A product wich is not FOR every body ! Lack of aptX HD does heart my feel of audiophile Only thing good about this is hype and good looks. Nothing incremental to lot of other devices available at half the price. Battery continues to be low performing.  I just compared my Xiaomi Redmi 3S with this fancy-pants, would be majorly dissapointed with iPhone X after Redmi 3S as i payed it almost 10 times less for almost same specs (at least that specs that are important for my smartphone usage). Not really into multimedia on the phone, never recorded video, camera for me is also non-relevant, so all advantages that iPhone X have in comparison with my one year old phone is basically non-relevant. I really don\\'t get it why Apple always put weak battery in their phones, i charge mine every second day and i fiddle with my phone at least 3-4 hours a day, playing games, watching youtube, playing music, wi-fi is constantly on.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI often play hearthstone on xiaomi, runs smooth and well, performance-wise never had a problem, only problem i had is with network gsm bands that are not supported with redmi 3s, but it still works fine. Overpriced phone. For the cost of replacing the phone\\'s glass, you could easily buy an OnePlus 5T/5 which is basically in the flagship bracket. \\r\\r\\n(Samsung Note 8/S8/S8+, Huawei Mate 10/Mate 10 Pro, iPhone X/8/8+, OnePlus 5T/5, LG V30/G6, Sony XZ Premium/XZ1, Essential PH-1, Razor Phone, Xiaomi Mi Mix 2, HTC U11+/U11/10/U Ultra, Google Pixel 2/2 XL, Oppo F5/R11 Plus, Nokia 7/8/9) Kk, 02 Nov 2017Yeah and I own a Sony phone and drives a BMW...

There are no buyer in my city, and fixed either to use or keep it boxed for resale. Finally its not worth a dime, to the efforts I have gone through, until only Amoled is intro first time in ten years by Apple. My conclusion damit not even worth having it, I repent!  IMO, it\\'s better if the phone directly goes to home screen after successful Face ID unlock than manually swiping it. I really don\\'t care about my lockscreen. It\\'s just for security purposes against unwanted users. They have done this since iOS 10 Touch ID though there\\'s a workaround for iOS 10. So far, this is what I\\'ve missed from iOS 9 - direct unlock to home screen. X means Xperiments \\r\\r\\nThis is more to an experiments phone by Iphone \\r\\r\\nNext year iphone will be better as users who bought this Â?xperimentÂ? phone will start to feedback on what problem this phone face and what are good about it. \\r\\r\\nThe high price for this phone is to fund apple....simple as that.

Did not feel any area gain, but good to be back to one hand operation.\\r\\n I like the X and still have it on pre-order. But planning to cancel it. Neither color options wowed me when I saw them.

Because am a french guy and it seem you donÂ?t understand me. I say apple abandoned glass back 7 years ago with iphone 4s. Now all brands including apple use glass back because samsung made it famous with galaxy s6 generation. Nobody used it when apple released it with iphone 4 but now everybody follow. In others terms samsung revolutioned glass back design. Do you understand this time? I was droid all the way, i\\'ve had HTC, then Samsung, then Sony, as stand alone devices they\\'re great, it\\'s when you need to connect them to other things that the problems start to appear. In my opinion android is the more flexible platform you can customise it so it looks just the way you want it, with Apple you don\\'t have that, but iOS is more stable less glitchy, and the phones themselves are built to a higher quality. I\\'m getting my iphone x on the 3rd, the reason i\\'m going for the x rather than the 8 is the screen and the fact that it will probably hold it\\'s value better. To sum up iphone aren\\'t cutting edge anymore and probably haven\\'t been for a few years, but they are a good solid reliable package that hold their value well.

An always on 3D touch home button which simulates a real button for unlocking the phone and going back to home screen by pressing the home button area from any app, game or video. It also gives a feeling of under display fingerprint sensor as you can just press the home button and it\\'ll be unlocked by iris or face recognition,  It\\'s really strange that Apple who introduced 3d touch first is relying upon swiping which is very uncomfortable instead of providing a 3d touch home button  apple never blow back / explode. hehe and frame still with aloy not cheapy TikoRacer, 02 Nov 2017Stop your fanboyism, Apple came first with glass panels at front and back with the iPhone 4, n... moreand Samsung had its first glass back with S6 in 2015.

An iPhone could have 2GB ram (like the 6s) and would still beat in terms of speed a 3,4GB ram android phone. Thats because of the iphone operating system smoothness and magic. You went from apple to android and thats why u think that 4gb ram is very much and will be very fast. If u take my advice, only worth to go from apple to android is to try a note samsung serie, or a Z5 even a s7 but huawei and shit like that are trash. If u like nexus designs they are okay too. I was an android user for 6 years as well and im on apple products now thats why i can tell the difference and the struggle with RAM bettween ios and android OS I wouldn\\'t buy this phone even if it was $700, my god that phone looks ugly in every dimension. I would still buy phones with some bezels but this iPhone X is eXtreme on a personal level for those who hate bezels so much lol. Apple went too far in designing something beyond future which won\\'t be popular until in 10 years time. I\\'m not criticizing on Apple\\'s product, but only a tech enthusiast would buy this phone and review this on YouTube warning us not to buy this sh#t.  Well, I guess R.I.P iPhone 9, Samsung Galaxy Note 6 and OnePlus 4. They were great phones, but had to be skipped by the manufacturer. I am really devastated on what happened to them. iPhone 11 will be I-magination.  Anonymous, 01 Nov 2017Speed is a huge difference? So how much worse is android in terms of speed?In many cases, IPhones beat Android phones in speed and processing. Nowadays the line and difference in speed on real world experience is blurred. Sure IPhone is still faster but by only a milliseconds. Eventually Android phones will be just as fast as IPhones in real world usage, with IPhones only being faster by nanoseconds. The only thing holding Android back is software issues and lag, but many Android firms have been trying to reduce those problems.

It has an OLED Display per Apple\\'s Technical Specifications. https://www.apple.com/iphone-x/specs/  There have been some discussions which reflect Super AMOLED solved the screen burn problems associated with OLED Displays but I can tell you first hand my previous device, a Galaxy S7 Edge had the Super AMOLED Display and experienced a small amount of screen burn but much less the my Galaxy S6 device. I doubt there are any OLED, AMOLED or Surper AMOLED Displays which are immune to screen burn but some are a lot more resistant than others. It will be interesting to see how this plays out in the iPhone X since most iPhone users keep their devices longer than their competitors. If iPhone X has screen burn issues we\\'ll be hearing about them in less than a year. huh, 28 Oct 2017this is the iphone x, not the iphone 7.Read the statement I responded to, the member was making a statement about the iPhone 7. Anonymous, 28 Oct 2017ItÂ?s the same, just that Super AMOLED is a Marketing Name for OLED from SamsungNo, they\\'re not the same. Super AMOLED outdoes its predecessor and other technologies in the same generation by integrating the touch-sensor component to the screen rather than being installed separately above it. Comparing it to AMOLED, its screen is essentially brighter and its power consumption is lower both by 20%. It also addresses the formers sunlight reflection downside by lowering it to 80%. In effect, it produces brighter and more vivid display regardless of external light intensity. Moreover, it promises wider viewing angle, superb outdoor readability and zero motion blurs with video or dynamic displays. Matt Perkins, 28 Oct 2017This information needs updated.

It\\'s about the fact that I feel comfortable and prefer the Apps, iTunes and other support software that provide the experience of using/ owning an iPhone. \\r\\r\\nI happen to like the shape and build of the iPhones, and lastly, I like the continuity of staying with Apple products, if a different brand inspires me more so then i\\'ll jump ship, but until then i\\'m happy to use Apple products ... for my reasons, not yours! \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI don\\'t care that another brand has had many of the features that iPhone will now start to adopt, I don\\'t care that other brands are more wallet friendly (i\\'m on contract not prepay), I don\\'t care for being badged one of the sheep.  \\r\\r\\nI consciously choose to continue using an iPhone, just as a Samsung fan (the other flock of sheep) choose to use Samsung/ other phones for their own reasons. dd, 18 Oct 2017lol future proof its already dead in the water In fairness, Its IP67 certified, so ok for 30 mins at a depth of 1 metre!

Its just that I sort of \"look down\" on them for the things they get, thats all. They have cheaper things there, and yet they can\\'t afford some things like the one I said previously, like seriously, or some cheaper ones that have a common standard price of high-end flagships better to say. This is just how I look on them sometimes, and one reason that made them like that is because of how their currency works, a smartphone cost around RM3000-4000 for high-end flagship and they earn slightly higher than that value. Their currency is all messed up. Sometimes I feel bad for them because of how their currency works, where smartphones are like more expensive than a television.

Rounded corners are a relatively tiny change and an old one at that (the Palm Pre had rounded corners). \\r\\r\\nBut then companies like LG, Essential and then Apple started cutting off larger portions. LG did it to fit a Â?secondary screenÂ? on the same line as the selfie camera, Essential just jammed the selfie camera in the top row of the screen and Apple was even more aggressive. \\r\\r\\nAnd our readers want none of that Â? only a quarter of voters are okay with any sort of screen cutout. ItÂ?s a roughly even split between those who only accept small cutouts and those that will agree to a big chunk of their screen being taken away in the name of a great feature. \\r\\r\\nStill, the overwhelming portion of the vote Â? 60% - went to the Rounded corners option. It is curious that the traditional rectangular screen got relatively weak support. We think this means that rounded corners are in as a design element.

Only iPhones where people whine about new designs.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe rat race to get the X before the year ends and spend $200 more over the 8 Plus which essentially has same specs as the X is for people to chase this ego-driven feeling of having it before more people have it.

X is able to reboot the naming for iPhones. Only the iPhone 4 was named properly for the generation it was released.

Ok, i promised myself i will refrain from commenting on this phone or the 8, but come on Apple, really? I mean, the software is kickass as always, but when we take a look at the hardware, I just have to see the iPhone 6 plus or the iPhone 7 plus in order to realize that they have a much better battery than the X. Not to mention the dimensions too.. it is thicker, heavier, etc. So, yeah, it has a new display (bought from Samsung), it has FaceID (exists since god knows when) and It has wireless charging (Samsung also has), AR(Asus ZenFone had before) and several other things. So, If i am to buy the new phone, I basically have to do it because of the AR and AI support. But AR, i have already seen and iOS 11 will also be available on your other device (the 6s plus), so besides from animating emojis and algorithms that calculate the camera real time, is that a reason enough to pay $1300 dollars (europe) for a phone that has wireless charging WHICH YOU HAVE TO BUY SEPARATELY? I mean come onnnnnnnnnnnnn... And when they say \"fully bezelless\" what the f*** does that mean, explain it to me,because i see bezels all around the display and there are some brands that have 1 bezel on the bottom, one on the top as well or just one and the X has them everywhere...

The price is justified with the following reasons.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n1. The A11 chip is super fast, even par with latest MacBook pro performance. this phone will be fresh for next 5 years (I derived this from my iPhone 5S bought 4 years back but still working great specifically super fast with latest iOS 11)\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n 2. Apple continuously putting efforts to revamp the underneath stuffs. Example the current iOS 11 comes with AFS file system which is totally safe, reliable and provides super fast performance. They revamped the total File system that supports 4 years old phone too...\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n3. Apple support. If anything happens within the warranty period, no questions asked you can get a replacement\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n4. Also Apple is supporting the 4 year old iPhone 5s with the new image and file format that improves the quality as well as cut the image / video size to half. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\n5. The Note 8 also expensive with $930 and the iPhone comes with $999 tag. $70 difference only but you can get a phone for 5 year (if you are not tempted to buy new one between) I am sure after 2 years Note 8 will be slow down and eventually will die within 3 years.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nYou just think the above points and take a call whether the difference of $70 is expensive.\\r\\n Im actually surprised, iphone x is only few milimeters larger than 4.7inch models so i was expecting something around 2000-2400 mAh; this will be acepted positively what a shame iphone x 5.8\" display with 2716 battery ?! \\r\\r\\nand so expensive to buy 1000!! believe me thats a joke you can buy any android phone with bezel screen better specs than iphone x ......3G ram! android got 6 even 8! of ram \\r\\r\\nVery disapointed of this phone \\r\\r\\nAPPLE JUST STEALING MONEY  \\r\\r\\nAn advice : DONT buy this if you an iphone fan please buy 7 or 7 plus NOT 8 because both have same specs even 7 series are better a bit in battery life nd FREE fast charging....BE INSANE  puremind, 25 Sep 2017You are comparing apple with oranges.

Undoubtedly iPhone X is a revolution in Apple history.It has to be added that Apple had no alternatives but joining a group of hi ends with new norms and criteria in smartdevice history....And I bet that for these specifications iPhone X Will be the most selling smartdevice at least for 3 years....However still I believe that lack of a dedicated memory slot , audio jack , WiFi direct , dual band ,USB 3.1+otg and 4000 mah battery for the security reasons are the great threat to iPhones security!!!?A recent incident proved that even iPhone X is vulnerable too !!!Nevertheless congratulations to Apple for its greatest effort in innovation and joining Samsung,LG,HTC club and ... in new era of new technology though IPhone X has made for the most HAVES !!!

Feels like X is a rushed product and with beta features.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nJust going to wait for the X\\'s successor. Either A12 or A13 in 2019. The #13 is my lucky number. Apple will rehash the same design for the next few years. The iPhone 6 felt beta with only 1gb RAM and many hated the antenna lines. Then it improved with the 7 series by having darker options, 3gb RAM on the Plus, and fast A10 chip.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nDon\\'t fall for the X hype. Feels like the iPhone 4, 5, and 6 hype. A stronger twin will be released 10 months after it and with more RAM and fingerprint sensor on the display. Dunno if any one else noticed, but the iPhone X has the same quoted battery life as the 8 Plus rather than the 8.

It\\'s 174 g not 174 kgs to make users unable to carry it. I slightly agree with you on the design front though, they could have avoided the cutout and provided better design for the back.

But when we run certain apps this phone will be slow as any other with 3GB ram or less.\" I had iPhone 6s with me for about 15 months until its motherboard died and during those months i had never experienced what you are saying here. 6s was never slow during game play, even while playing Infinity Blade game series. And i am not expecting iPhone 8s and Xs to be slow either. Buddy, iPhones\\' strong point is iOS and its smoothness all through. My 6s was working like a charm till that dreadful day, and i only think 8s and Xs as definitely far better in performance. Only things i didn\\'t like in iPhone X are as usual its exorbitant price tag and camera(even though Apple mentioned it as new sensor, but i feel it is a remodeled 7+ sensor). When you are charging $999 for a phone, one will expect a different camera sensor than what you will get in an 8+. Every year around this time Apple releases its new iPhones and every year we get a few early reviews in just before the phone goes on sale. \\r\\r\\nBut this time, Apple has a more interesting phone coming out in November - the iPhone X - casting a shadow over the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus - are they still worth it with a design dating back to 2014? Let\\'s see what the reviewers say.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe consensus is that the Apple iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are let down by a tired design that\\'s built on huge bezels and familiar aesthetics, but the new camera, wireless charging and chip partially make up for it. \\r\\r\\nEngadget praises the iPhone 8 duo on the new excellent camera and a promising AR implementation but takes a point away for the design, despite the use of \"grippier\" glass. \\r\\r\\nTheVerge makes mostly the same points - fast new processor, excellent camera and having wireless charging is nice. But Nilay Patel isn\\'t too thrilled with the stiff design either. \\r\\r\\nTechCrunch focuses on the new camera of the iPhone 8 Plus in their review hailing the new 12MP main camera as killer and the 8 Plus\\'s Portrait Lighting as \"working better than it has any right to\". \\r\\r\\nThe same theme continues with The Telegraph - praise for the significantly improved camera and the new faster chipset. The new glass back gets a positive mention too. \\r\\r\\nThe New York Times review brands the new iPhones as the \"ultimate refinement before eternal retirement\". \\r\\r\\nThe Wall Street Journal (subscription required) is the only media that outright advises you avoid the iPhone 8 on the grounds that the 8 doesn\\'t do enough to be considered more than a 7s, slightly better camera notwithstanding. \\r\\r\\nJohn Gruber aka the Daring Fireball brands the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus \"pretty good for a boring update\". \\r\\r\\nCNET would have you wait to see the iPhone X before deciding on buying either an iPhone 8 or 8 Plus. \\r\\r\\nIn its brief write-up USA Today describes the new glass and metal design as \"lovely\". \\r\\r\\nWired shares TechCrunch\\' sentiment that the new camera is kick-ass. It also hails the glass design as a big improvement coupled with wireless charging. \\r\\r\\nAnyway we\\'ll have even more to say when we get our hands on the new iPhones - camera samples, battery tests, loudspeaker test - all that jazz. So stay tuned! I would buy this phone just for the BBOS 10 feeling that it gives. Stuart Reeves, 19 Sep 2017My sister\\'s S5 has no burn in since 2014 up to now.

This is going to be miles ahead of all the other chipsets in the market. Really Apple, has kept itself ahead in the race by making sure that they own every technology that goes into making their phone. The hardware, the OS, the Developer Network or the Applications. I am sure what looks as the most costliest phone will also be a big seller in the market.  I think face id is not a good idea for me. Because some people are very busy not aware of using or trying to look at with your phone while working or doing. But instead touch id still remain on iPhone X, maybe you can do  a lot having your finger is your primarily using when you use your phone. \\r\\r\\nHow ever i love my iPhone since i switched to iPhone 5. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nPlease respect my opinion. Thanks! Im still sceptical about the bezel. Hands on video shown that it is thicker than it seem. Or maybe it just the lighting. Does this really count as bezel less? The chassis is kinda fat too. Hmm. Hope they can improve the design next year. Just a little bit more. Seriously. Just a little tiny bit more improvement it can be perfect. But of course I bet the chinese will copy this design in just a few months. Especially that Xiaomi or Oppo folks. Looking forward to the next smartphone evolution.  this is worth to buy for me. i have the money to buy every apple product. its not hard to spend my money to buy apple products.    Don\\'t rush to buy it, let us wait till next year, to find whether its antenna works. I suspect troubles on the way. It will be fun if it needs to be kept in X position to get reception.

Blazing processor speeds aren\\'t truly discernible unless the device is in hardcore gaming environments. For these applications AnTuTu speeds are the most useful measure of user experience. The A11 still tops the charts at 226,000 compare to 182,000 for the Spapdragon 835 or about 20% faster. What isn\\'t mentioned is bloatware, which Apple doesn\\'t allow on it\\'s iPhones. Custom ROM\\'s are now available for Android devices which can eliminate the bloatware allowing a much faster and smoother user experience. On a pure Android Software Device the A11 CPU doesn\\'t have any real advantage and when the Qualcomm\\'s 936 Prototype is released next year Apple hasn\\'t shown it\\'s flexible enough to counter with a better CPU anytime in the near future.

A simple image measurement makes the screen just under 9mm narrower than the outer edge of the body, making the bezels around 4.48mm on each side.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nComparing the same measurement on the note 8, I get about 2.3mm, on width, and 18mm on height The battery life is surely s**t, as in all iphones. Bezel-less. I do not think that is the appropriate word to begin with. Its because it is not bezelless. Look at that minimum strip right along the screen and towards the edge. The samsugg is the truly edgeless or boarderless. Look at how apple took the top design as if those top sensors and the two supposed screen in its side look utterly riduculous enough. And take note that is no body is going to use those screen spaces. Samsung and LG is smart enough not to go with the apple whole front screen insead of looking a screen with a notch, they instead get to go with top and chin boarder to at least for aesthetics looks more proportionate.  Dear GSMARENA,\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe screen size of 5.8 inches is measured up to the curved corners only. It\\'s actually 5.85 when measured in rectangular shape as stated in Apple website.

When Android\\'s Oreo update is distributed in a few weeks iOS well fall even further behind, an outdated operating system which allows for ZERO CUSTOMIZATION. Apple only allows it\\'s devices to do what Apple wants you to be able to do. Just another example of Apple\\'s Proprietary Stranglehold all in the name of Corporate Profits!

Then you extend this \\'learning\\' path of this computer software so that a number of degrees of differences of the original red is sill mapped to the output word \\'Red\\'. At the end of this learning process your software will be able to \\'recognize\\' an input color and decides if it has to return the \\'Red\\' word as output or another string.

This phone look like a half-baked premium being pushed to the market, just to test how loyalty from our iFans. We can pay but not blindly pay for such thing. Face ID is not mature and can be thrown away on the next version if there is enough evidence this phone can be unlocked straight away by authorities or thieves. Honestly, I miss my touchID so much. the more negative comments the better the phone did.  Recommendation for those who even consider this phone. Don\\'t buy it yet. \\r\\r\\nWait for version 2. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThis year Apple failed to embed touchID under the screen. So they have no choice but to push their software teams to make Animoji, as a selling point.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIf your phone is broken, iPhone 8 is your best choice. Stay way from experimental version 1 Apple stuff. FaceID is not as good as TouchID yet.. its prone to failure and disappointments.    3GB RAM - 2K screen and $1500+ Canadian dollars for 256GB. unacceptable. apple has double slapped us, fans.

Double tap to wake? Wow thats awesome. I dont even have that on my XZP.....  With iPhone X preorders in 6 weeks and availability sometime after that, it leaves a large window for discussions about the pros and cons of this device. Apple is for the most part targeting current and past iPhone users. They\\'re not likely to attract many crossover android users since most of the new features on this device have been components on android smartphones for some time now at a significantly lower price point. Facial Recognition, Wireless Charging, Imersive LED Display and Glass Body among others. A good portion of the early debate has revolved around cost. Even longtime iPhone devotees are going to think twice about the cost/value metric. Not only for the X flagship between $999.00 and $1,149.00 but even more so for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus which are priced at $699.00 and $799.00 respectively. By the time you buy Earpods, Lighting Dock, Wireless Charger and a Case you\\'ll have invested over $1,300.00 for the 64 GB and $1,450.00 for a 256 GB iPhone X and between $1,000.00 to $1,100.00 for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. Currently you can purchase a new iPhone 7 Plus in the mid $400.00 range. The new iPhone offerings are no doubt great devices but even hardcore applehead\\'s will give flagship android devices a good look before they throw down that much cash on their next smartphone.

It takes away from everything that is associated with Apple, such as the new iPhone X.

When you boot your iPhone it always first ask passcode, you can\\'t also open your phone with touch ID if you first haven\\'t wrote passcode. This feature came with iOS10 etc. i\\'m not sure why they do it, something to do with security i think?\\r\\n \\r\\r\\neven in the demo the screen said. use passcode before you can use your face ID etc. Then he used different iPhone from table it worked right away. Three things are annoying for me about the new iPhone X.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\n1. The ugly and annoying pop out back camera lens. \\r\\r\\n2. The bad display cut at the top. \\r\\r\\n3. The black strip around the display.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIf this phone is called with edge to edge display, what should we call the Samsung Galaxy S8 or even Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 with no stupid cut off display at top?\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI think Apple will come in two years with its new iPhone XI and call it a phone with EXTREME Edge to Edge display and then in 4 years with the name ULTRA FLAT BACK iPhone XII, with no pop out camera lens!!\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI am a fan of iPhone and Apple products, but hate the way that they fool us about their new ideas which we already saw in other brands or cruel idea of EXTRA over charge us for a little more storage space! The idea of offering only two versions of 64GB and 256GB is nothing more than sucking money from customers.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI may buy Apple products, but I don\\'t respect them for the way they treat us!

I think the galaxy Note 8 is better especially with the display and water resistance and RAM. but some of the features i do like is the augmented reality. the aniemoji is sorta gimmicy and the black bar at the top was a dumb idea because it might cut some things out on the screen.

AR and everything they showcase is already available with Sony. For tenth anniversary it was not at all major uphaul. May be 25 th anniversary they are innovative again ( punn. Intended). I am going to address the elephant in the room here, which is that iOS still can\\'t drive high resolution displays efficiently from a battery standpoint. No 4K display (2160p), not even 1440p only 1125p???\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nWith its massive display the iPhone X is one of the flagship phone with the smallest pixel density 458ppi vs. 537ppi for the LG V30 or 521ppi for the Note 8.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nBased on this it is obvious to me that Apple don\\'t take augmented reality seriously. How would Android fans turn to Apple when they persist in their avoidance of high resolution displays?\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nLG was able to fit a 3300mAh battery in a really thin device. Why can\\'t Apple finally build a battery in that will allow them to have better autonomy at high resolutions and deliver a more comfortable augmented reality experience? \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nIt could have been a justified choice if they were going to make the phone a battery beast (what everyone is craving for the moment) but they haven\\'t even provided the battery capacity yet, so don\\'t even expect them to use the smaller display resolution to outperform Android in terms of autonomy. Lost opportunity in my opinion.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nThe Note 8 is too heavy and I don\\'t like the elongated square design that much. \\r\\r\\nThe iPhone X doesn\\'t join the high resolution display club and won\\'t have the crazy batter size that people were hoping for. \\r\\r\\nNeither have an emphasis on audio quality.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nFor me it will be either LG V30 or Axon 9. As much as I love the LG V30, I would prefer a dual stereo speaker setup but it will depend on ZTE\\'S ability to fit them in a bezelless design.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nBut at least those two brands put on emphasis on audio and microphone quality. What good is great camera if the recorded sound is not even remotely professional grade?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n stupid copy of a genius work.

Then you will all know that\" connecting people\" . Apple and Samsung don\\'t count we Africans as customers to them, where is our price in new Apple phones list? At least Egypt,  Morocco,  Lybia, South Africa, Nigeria and my Country Ghana.  Adreno320, 12 Sep 2017mi Mix 2?yup, they copy Mi Mix design.... From the words of Diana Prince A.K.A. Wonder Woman, \"It\\'s hideous.\" 512 GB?? S Haddad, 12 Sep 2017This the best smart phone ever with the best and most secure iOS (Thumbs down) So basically a high end Android from last year with an exorbient price tag and shitty iOS? No thanks. The not so essential phone. Horrible design. Nothing works in the looks department. From the proportions to the way the edges and screen blend into each other to the odd camera protrusion.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nApple. Chinese phones costing  fourth have managed to do away with the camera hump. Which means even your so called next gen phone cannot rest flat on a table. Come on\\r\\n USer, 12 Sep 2017They keep copy Samsungit\\'s funny when you apple copy from Samsung! 3gb ram serious\\r\\n Steve Job would wake up and slap somebody... one word for now, \"ugly\" Imperator Neubaticus, 13 Sep 2017Giant forehead and chin?

I don\\'t like this \\'\\'Full Vision\\'\\' trend. But the othe iPhones are boring, keeping the same design but adding glass. And these cut outs are dumb.

Almost same camera as iphone 7 (dont tell me people that its cam is superior in any way because none of us has seen the real thing and we are all seeing apple\\'s marketing awesomeness ) \\r\\r\\n4. No touch ID. I still believe they came up with Face ID only because they couldnt find a place on the device to put a touch ID - not because Face ID is that awesome. If it was that awesome, they would have added it into the 8  plus and sold it for $100 more. (Oh by the way that is iPhone 8s in 2018).\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nI really really do not see any reason to put my $1000 on this device. \\r\\n \\r\\r\\nNo offence meant to apple fans, but this device is not about innovation anymore. It is more about catching up.\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nWireless charging was an innovation \\r\\r\\nQuick Charge was innovation \\r\\r\\nOLED was innovation \\r\\r\\nWhatever iphone 10 has are innovations made by others- what happened to you Apple?\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nSteve - I miss you. best what...?  go and check the turing phone... 12gigs of ram... insane specs  Bobusm, 13 Sep 2017I hope I will enjoy it.

Unlike many of the children on these boards, do act upon your own priorities and ignore the asinine comments that do no one any good. mojeda, 13 Sep 2017How is it in any way copying samsung?

I do like my Android phones, don\\'t get me wrong, but there are tons of apps I use on my IPads Which are not available on Android (or if they are they just not as reliable) so I hope I will like the phone.

For me it is on level with new Samsungs and LGs easily but it is very hard to comment before I hold one in my hands.  The iPhone X has a crazy tall aspect ratio of 19.5:9. This means the screen area is only about as high as that of a 5.4\" phone and videos get displayed at the size of a 4.9\" phone if they aren\\'t cropped! Tall aspect ratios are a bad thing, be careful before you buy! S Haddad, 12 Sep 2017This the best smart phone ever with the best and most secure iOS Typical apple fanboy.

Not to join the android vs iphone war but I\\'m curious what exactly iphone was the first to do my question is create either because much of us are aware that apple buys over then innovate stuff. Phone looks good but just my personal opinion the S8 looks better and have better specs but iOS no one can deny its secure OS. Looks like a cheap phone from china  awesome\\r\\n this phone copy and past of samsung s8  S Haddad, 12 Sep 2017This the best smart phone ever with the best and most secure iOS No, not.

I am an Android user for phone but IPad all the way for tablet for work and home. Had nearly every Android flagship in last 10 years. Only stayed away from Apple due to large screen to body ratio (and not only Apple to be fair - Sony and few others are on the list as well.)  \\r\\r\\nThis time we have serious IPhone available and I am tempted for first time in years. Say what you want about IOS but it is still most stable and most supported system for phones/tablets. Maybe you don\\'t use any pro apps but if you do you will find out that Android is poor at best - I work in music industry and what IOS achieved around music based apps is unbelievable. And this is possible due to stability and great IOS - no Android app is able to run steadily enough so it can be used for live music like we use on iPads - and that is a sign of great system. Sometimes is not about numbers but about reliability. I have LG G6 and Samsung S8 right now and both these things started to slow down and random moments and that is only about 3 months into use. Great phones - agree, but poor creative / professional tools.  This is the most ugly phone i have ever seen. \\r\\r\\nThey need another 2 years to make something close to S8 or even Mi Mix. No Headphone jack. PPI < 500. For a flagship Wtf ? \\r\\r\\n& copying samsung\\'s Infinity display.  no fingerprint sensor :)) Will Samsung be making that screen? :)\\r\\n \\r\\r\\nSuper AMOLED --> Super Retina :D   ? '"
